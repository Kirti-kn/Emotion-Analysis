# Emotion-Analysis
The reel sections shows the most relatable videos and those are solely based on the user's liking and disliking. This project scraps the hashtags of the posts in the explore section of an instagram account and uses Google Generative AI (genai) to tell the top 3-5 types of posts on your profile and your mental analysis.

- The two important files are reel_scrap.ipynb and hashtag_analysis.ipynb.
- The file "instagram_data.csv" was created during the testing of the program using a demo account. This will be created automatically if you run the reel_scrap.ipynb .
- Selenium webdriver is used for scraping the data from the web and Google generative AI is used for the emotion analysis.
