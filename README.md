# Emotion-Analysis
The reel sections shows the most relatable videos and those are solely based on the user's liking and disliking. Using Selenium, the program logs into a user's Instagram account and scrapes post and reel links from their "explore" section, which reflects their preferences. By extracting hashtags, the project identifies the genres of the posts, offering a window into the user's current interests. Utilizing GenAI for mental analysis, it categorizes the emotions potentially experienced by the user, providing a detailed percentage breakdown. This innovative approach combines the power of web scraping and advanced AI to deliver meaningful insights.
- The two important files are reel_scrap.ipynb and hashtag_analysis.ipynb.
- The file "instagram_data.csv" was created during the testing of the program using a demo account. This will be created automatically if you run the reel_scrap.ipynb .
- Selenium webdriver is used for scraping the data from the web and Google generative AI is used for the emotion analysis.
